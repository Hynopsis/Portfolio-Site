# [Portfolio Site](http://www.rpetersen4.btcwsd.com/Portfolio/)

This is a one page portfolio page using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and based on the freelancer [template](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/freelancer/).  It has strayed pretty far from the original template, but still uses some of the underlying php and modal code.  Feel free to use this in any variation if you find if useful.  

## Refresher Courses

This will eventually be moved to another individual site, but for now it is part of this one.  At the bottom of the page there is a Skill Test section which moves to another series of pages that I use for refreshing myself on various topics.  It works like flash cards.  It loads all the questions, answers, and hints from a database on load, then randomizes them.  If you know the answer to a question you can click the remove checkbox to remove the question from the pool.  If it has a hint, you can click the hint link to show it.  Either way you can click the show answer to verify your knowledge.  When you are ready you can click next question to generate another one.  Once all questions have been gone through (70 - 120 per topic), it will take the remaining questions and reshuffle them for viewing.  Once all questions have been removed you will be congratulated.  If you want to do it again you have to reload the page.
